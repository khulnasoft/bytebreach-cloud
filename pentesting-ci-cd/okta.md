## Basic Information

[Okta, Inc.](https://www.okta.com/) is recognized in the identity and access management sector for its cloud-based software solutions. These solutions are designed to streamline and secure user authentication across various modern applications. They cater not only to companies aiming to safeguard their sensitive data but also to developers interested in integrating identity controls into applications, web services, and devices.

The flagship offering from Okta is the **Okta Identity Cloud**. This platform encompasses a suite of products, including but not limited to:

- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Simplifies user access by allowing one set of login credentials across multiple applications.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhances security by requiring multiple forms of verification.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automates user account creation, update, and deactivation processes.
- **Universal Directory**: Enables centralized management of users, groups, and devices.
- **API Access Management**: Secures and manages access to APIs.

These services collectively aim to fortify data protection and streamline user access, enhancing both security and convenience. The versatility of Okta's solutions makes them a popular choice across various industries, beneficial to large enterprises, small companies, and individual developers alike. As of the last update in September 2021, Okta is acknowledged as a prominent entity in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) arena.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The main gola of Okta is to configure access to different users and groups to external applications. If you manage to **compromise administrator privileges in an Oktas** environment, you will highly probably able to **compromise all the other platforms the company is using**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
To perform a security review of an Okta environment you should ask for **administrator read-only access**.

## Directory

### People

From an attackers perspective, this is super interesting as you will be able to see **all the users registered**, their **email** addresses, the **groups** they are part of, **profiles** and even **devices** (mobiles along with their OSs).

For a whitebox review check that there aren't several "Pending user action" and "Password reset"

### Groups

This is where you find all the created groups in Okta. it's interesting to understand the different groups (set of **permissions**) that could be granted to **users**.\
It's possible to see the **people included inside groups** and **apps assigned** to each goup.

Ofc, any group with the name of **admin** is interesting, specially the group **Global Administrators,** check the members to learn who are the most privileged members.

From a whitebox review, there **shouldn't be more than 5 global admins** (better if there are only 2 or 3).

### Devices

Find here a **list of all the devices** of all the users. You can also see if it's being **actively managed** or not.

### Profile Editor

Here is possible to observe how key information such as first names, last names, emails, usernames... are shared between Okta and other applications. This is interesting because if a user can **modify in Okta a field** (such as his name or email) that then is used by an **external application** to **identify** the user, an insider could try to **take over other accounts**.

Moreover, in the profile **`User (default)`** from Okta you can see **which fields** each **user** has and which ones are **writable** by users. If you cannot see the admin panel, just go to **update your profile** information and you will see which fields you can update (note that to update an email address you will need to verify it).

### Directory Integrations

Directories allow you to import people from existing sources. I guess here you will see the users imported from other directories.

I haven't seen it, but I guess this is interesting to find out **other directories that Okta is using to import users** so if you **compromise that directory** you could set some attributes values in the users created in Okta and **maybe compromise the Okta env**.

### Profile Sources

A profile source is an **application that acts as a source of truth** for user profile attributes. A user can only be sourced by a single application or directory at a time.

I haven't seen it, so any information about security and hacking regarding this option is appreciated.
