## Cache Poisoning

The Git action [**action/cache**](https://github.com/actions/cache) introduces a caching mechanism in the Continuous Integration (CI) process, encompassing two critical stages:

1. **Run Action**: This stage involves searching for and retrieving cached data during the CI run. The search utilizes a unique cache key, yielding two outcomes:
    - **Cache-hit**: The requested data is found in the cache and is consequently retrieved for immediate use.
    - **Cache-miss**: No matching data is found in the cache, prompting a fresh download of the required files and directories, akin to a first-time request.

2. **Post Workflow Action**: This stage is dedicated to caching data post the CI workflow. Specifically, if a cache-miss occurs during the run action, the current state of the specified directories is cached using the provided key. This process is automated and does not necessitate explicit invocation.

#### Security Measures: Cache Isolation and Access Restrictions

To maintain security and ensure cache isolation, access restrictions are enforced, creating a logical separation between different branches. For instance, a cache created for branch **Feature-A** (with its base in the main branch) will be inaccessible to a pull request for branch **Feature-B** (also based in the main branch).

The cache action adheres to a specific search order:
- It first seeks cache hits within the same branch as the workflow run.
- If unsuccessful, it extends the search to the parent branch and other upstream branches.

Importantly, cache access is branch-scoped, extending across all workflows and runs of a specific branch. Additionally, GitHub enforces a read-only policy for cache entries once they are created, prohibiting any modifications.

#### Real-World Implication: From Low to High-Permission Workflow Attack

An illustrative CI scenario demonstrates how an attacker might leverage cache poisoning to escalate privileges from a low-permission workflow to a high-permission one:

- The **Unit-test** workflow, responsible for running unit tests and code coverage tools, is assumed to employ a compromised or vulnerable tool. This workflow utilizes the **action/cache** Git action, making the cache accessible to any workflow.
- The **Release** workflow, tasked with building and releasing the application artifact, optimizes its operations by caching Golang dependencies.

In this scenario, the unit-test workflow introduces a malicious cache entry by substituting a legitimate Golang logging library (`go
