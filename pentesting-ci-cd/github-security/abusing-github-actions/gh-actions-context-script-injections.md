## Basic Information

Note that there are certain [**github contexts**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context) whose values are **controlled** by the **user** creating the PR. If the github action is using that **data to execute anything**, it could lead to **arbitrary code execution**. These contexts typically end with `body`, `default_branch`, `email`, `head_ref`, `label`, `message`, `name`, `page_name`,`ref`, and `title`. For example (list from this [**writeup**](https://medium.com/tinder/exploiting-github-actions-on-open-source-projects-5d93936d189f)):

* github.event.comment.body
* github.event.issue.body
* github.event.issue.title
* github.head\_ref
* github.pull\_request.\*
* github.\*.\*.authors.name
* github.\*.\*.authors.email

Note that here are **less obvious sources** of potentially untrusted input, such as branch names and email addresses, which can be **quite flexible in terms of their permitted content**. For example, `zzz";echo${IFS}"hello";#` would be a valid branch name and would be a possible attack vector for a target repository.

### Example of a script injection attack <a href="#example-of-a-script-injection-attack" id="example-of-a-script-injection-attack"></a>

A script injection attack can occur directly within a workflow's inline script. In the following example, an action uses an **expression to test the validity of a pull request title**, but also adds the risk of script injection:

```yaml
      - name: Check PR title
        run: |
          title="${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"
          if [[ $title =~ ^octocat ]]; then
          echo "PR title starts with 'octocat'"
          exit 0
          else
          echo "PR title did not start with 'octocat'"
          exit 1
          fi
```

Before the shell script is run, the expressions inside `${{ }}` are **evaluated** and then substituted with the resulting values, which can make it **vulnerable to shell command injection**.

To inject commands into this workflow, the attacker could create a pull request with a title of **`a"; ls $GITHUB_WORKSPACE"`**

In this example, the **`"`** character is used to interrupt the `title=`**`"${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"`** statement, allowing the `ls` command to be executed on the runner.
