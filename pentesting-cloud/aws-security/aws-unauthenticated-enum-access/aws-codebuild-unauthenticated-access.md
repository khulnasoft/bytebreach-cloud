## CodeBuild

For more info check this page:

{% content-ref url="../aws-services/aws-codebuild-enum.md" %}
[aws-codebuild-enum.md](../aws-services/aws-codebuild-enum.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### buildspec.yml

If you compromise write access over a repository containing a file named **`buildspec.yml`**, you could **backdoor** this file, which specifies the **commands that are going to be executed** inside a CodeBuild project and exfiltrate the secrets, compromise what is done and also compromise the **CodeBuild IAM role credentials**.

Note that even if there isn't any **`buildspec.yml`** file but you know Codebuild is being used (or a different CI/CD) **modifying some legit code** that is going to be executed can also get you a reverse shell for example.

For some related information you could check the page about how to attack Github Actions (similar to this):

{% content-ref url="../../../pentesting-ci-cd/github-security/abusing-github-actions/" %}

{% endcontent-ref %}
