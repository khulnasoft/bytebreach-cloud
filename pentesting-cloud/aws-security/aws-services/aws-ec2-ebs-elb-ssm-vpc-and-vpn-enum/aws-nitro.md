## Basic Information

AWS Nitro is a suite of **innovative technologies** that form the underlying platform for AWS EC2 instances. Introduced by Amazon to **enhance security, performance, and reliability**, Nitro leverages custom **hardware components and a lightweight hypervisor**. It abstracts much of the traditional virtualization functionality to dedicated hardware and software, **minimizing the attack surface** and improving resource efficiency. By offloading virtualization functions, Nitro allows EC2 instances to deliver **near bare-metal performance**, making it particularly beneficial for resource-intensive applications. Additionally, the Nitro Security Chip specifically ensures the **security of the hardware and firmware**, further solidifying its robust architecture.

### Nitro Enclaves

**AWS Nitro Enclaves** provides a secure, **isolated compute environment within Amazon EC2 instances**, specifically designed for processing highly sensitive data. Leveraging the AWS Nitro System, these enclaves ensure robust **isolation and security**, ideal for **handling confidential information** such as PII or financial records. They feature a minimalist environment, significantly reducing the risk of data exposure. Additionally, Nitro Enclaves support cryptographic attestation, allowing users to verify that only authorized code is running, crucial for maintaining strict compliance and data protection standards.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Nitro Enclave images are **run from inside EC2 instances** and you cannot see from the AWS web console if an EC2 instances is running images in Nitro Enclave or not.
{% endhint %}

### Nitro Enclave CLI installation

Follow the all instructions [**from the documentation**](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/event/dashboard/en-US/workshop/1-my-first-enclave/1-1-nitro-enclaves-cli#run-connect-and-terminate-the-enclave). However, these are the most important ones:

```bash
# Install tools
sudo amazon-linux-extras install aws-nitro-enclaves-cli -y
sudo yum install aws-nitro-enclaves-cli-devel -y

# Config perms
sudo usermod -aG ne $USER
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Check installation
nitro-cli --version

# Start and enable the Nitro Enclaves allocator service.
sudo systemctl start nitro-enclaves-allocator.service && sudo systemctl enable nitro-enclaves-allocator.service
```

### Nitro Enclave Images

The images that you can run in Nitro Enclave are based on docker images, so you can create your Nitro Enclave images from docker images like:

```bash
# You need to have the docker image accesible in your running local registry
# Or indicate the full docker image URL to access the image
nitro-cli build-enclave --docker-uri <docker-img>:<tag> --output-file nitro-img.eif
```

As you can see the Nitro Enclave images use the extension **`eif`** (Enclave Image File).

The output will look similar to:

```
Using the locally available Docker image...
Enclave Image successfully created.
{
  "Measurements": {
    "HashAlgorithm": "Sha384 { ... }",
    "PCR0": "e199261541a944a93129a52a8909d29435dd89e31299b59c371158fc9ab3017d9c450b0a580a487e330b4ac691943284",
    "PCR1": "bcdf05fefccaa8e55bf2c8d6dee9e79bbff31e34bf28a99aa19e6b29c37ee80b214a414b7607236edf26fcb78654e63f",
    "PCR2": "2e1fca1dbb84622ec141557dfa971b4f8ea2127031b264136a20278c43d1bba6c75fea286cd4de9f00450b6a8db0e6d3"
  }
}
```

As per [**the documentation**](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/event/dashboard/en-US/workshop/1-my-first-enclave/1-1-nitro-enclaves-cli#run-connect-and-terminate-the-enclave), in order to run an enclave image you need to assign it memory of at least 4 times the **`eif`** file takes in disk.
