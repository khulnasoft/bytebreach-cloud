## Lambda

For more information check:

{% content-ref url="../../aws-services/aws-lambda-enum.md" %}
[aws-lambda-enum.md](../../aws-services/aws-lambda-enum.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Lambda Layer Persistence

It's possible to **introduce/backdoor a layer to execute arbitrary code** when the lambda is executed in a stealthy way:

{% content-ref url="aws-lambda-layers-persistence.md" %}
[aws-lambda-layers-persistence.md](aws-lambda-layers-persistence.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Lambda Extension Persistence

Abusing Lambda Layers it's also possible to abuse extensions and persiste in the lambda but also steal and modify requests.

{% content-ref url="aws-abusing-lambda-extensions.md" %}
[aws-abusing-lambda-extensions.md](aws-abusing-lambda-extensions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Via resource policies

It's possible to grant access to different lambda actions (such as invoke or update code) to external accounts:

### Versions, Aliases & Weights

A Lambda can have **different versions** (with different code each version).\
Then, you can create **different aliases with different versions** of the lambda and set different weights to each.\
This way an attacker could create a **backdoored version 1** and a **version 2 with only the legit code** and **only execute the version 1 in 1%** of the requests to remain stealth.

### Version Backdoor + API Gateway

1. Copy the original code of the Lambda
2. **Create a new version backdooring** the original code (or just with malicious code). Publish and **deploy that version** to $LATEST
   1. Call the API gateway related to the lambda to execute the code
3. **Create a new version with the original code**, Publish and deploy that **version** to $LATEST.
   1. This will hide the backdoored code in a previous version
4. Go to the API Gateway and **create a new POST method** (or choose any other method) that will execute the backdoored version of the lambda: `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:<acc_id>:function:<func_name>:1`
   1. Note the final :1 of the arn **indicating the version of the function** (version 1 will be the backdoored one in this scenario).
5. Select the POST method created and in Actions select **`Deploy API`**
6. Now, when you **call the function via POST your Backdoor** will be invoked

### Cron/Event actuator

The fact that you can make **lambda functions run when something happen or when some time pass** makes lambda a nice and common way to obtain persistence and avoid detection.\
Here you have some ideas to make your **presence in AWS more stealth by creating lambdas**.

* Every time a new user is created lambda generates a new user key and send it to the attacker.
* Every time a new role is created lambda gives assume role permissions to compromised users.
* Every time new cloudtrail logs are generated, delete/alter them
