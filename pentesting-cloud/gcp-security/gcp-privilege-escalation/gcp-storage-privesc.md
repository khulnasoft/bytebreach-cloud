## Storage

Basic Information:

{% content-ref url="../gcp-services/gcp-storage-enum.md" %}
[gcp-storage-enum.md](../gcp-services/gcp-storage-enum.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### `storage.objects.get`

This permission allows you to **download files stored inside Cloud Storage**. This will potentially allow you to escalate privileges because in some occasions **sensitive information is saved there**. Moreover, some GCP services stores their information in buckets:

* **GCP Composer**: When you create a Composer Environment the **code of all the DAGs** will be saved inside a **bucket**. These tasks might contain interesting information inside of their code.
* **GCR (Container Registry)**: The **image** of the containers are stored inside **buckets**, which means that if you can read the buckets you will be able to download the images and **search for leaks and/or source code**.

### `storage.objects.setIamPolicy`

You can give you permission to **abuse any of the previous scenarios of this section**.

### **`storage.buckets.setIamPolicy`**

For an example on how to modify permissions with this permission check this page:

{% content-ref url="../gcp-unaunthenticated-enum-and-access/gcp-storage-unauthenticated-enum/gcp-public-buckets-privilege-escalation.md" %}
[gcp-public-buckets-privilege-escalation.md](../gcp-unaunthenticated-enum-and-access/gcp-storage-unauthenticated-enum/gcp-public-buckets-privilege-escalation.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### `storage.hmacKeys.create`

Cloud Storage's "interoperability" feature, designed for **cross-cloud interactions** like with AWS S3, involves the **creation of HMAC keys for Service Accounts and users**. An attacker can exploit this by **generating an HMAC key for a Service Account with elevated privileges**, thus **escalating privileges within Cloud Storage**. While user-associated HMAC keys are only retrievable via the web console, both the access and secret keys remain **perpetually accessible**, allowing for potential backup access storage. Conversely, Service Account-linked HMAC keys are API-accessible, but their access and secret keys are not retrievable post-creation, adding a layer of complexity for continuous access.

```bash
# Create key
gsutil hmac create <sa-email>

# Configure gsutil to use it
gsutil config -a

# Use it
gsutil ls gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
```

Another exploit script for this method can be found [here](https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/GCP-IAM-Privilege-Escalation/blob/master/ExploitScripts/storage.hmacKeys.create.py).

## `storage.objects.create`, `storage.objects.delete` = Storage Write permissions

In order to **create a new object** inside a bucket you need `storage.objects.create` and, according to [the docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-permissions#object\_permissions), you need also `storage.objects.delete` to **modify** an existent object.

A very **common exploitation** of buckets where you can write in cloud is in case the **bucket is saving web server files**, you might be able to **store new code** that will be used by the web application.

### Composer

**Composer** is **Apache Airflow** managed inside GCP. It has several interesting features:

* It runs inside a **GKE cluster**, so the **SA the cluster uses is accessible** by the code running inside Composer
* It stores the **code in a bucket**, therefore, **anyone with write access over that bucket** is going to be able to change/add a DGA code (the code Apache Airflow will execute)\
  Then, if you have **write access over the bucket Composer is using** to store the code, you can **privesc to the SA running in the GKE cluster**.

### Cloud Functions

* Cloud Functions code is stored in Storage, so **overwriting it, it's possible to execute arbitrary code**.

### App Engine

* App Engine source code is stored in buckets, **overwriting the code it could be possible to execute arbitrary code. THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE**
* **It looks like container layers are stored in the bucket, maybe changing those?**

### GCR

* **Google Container Registry** stores the images inside buckets, if you can **write those buckets** you might be able to **move laterally to where those buckets are being run.**
  * The bucket used by GCR will have an URL similar to `gs://<eu/usa/asia/nothing>.artifacts.<project>.appspot.com` (The top level subdomains are specified [here](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling)).
