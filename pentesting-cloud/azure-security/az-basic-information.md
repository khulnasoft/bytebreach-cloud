## Organization Hierarchy

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (271).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Management Groups

If your organization has **many Azure subscriptions**, you may need a way to efficiently **manage access**, policies, and compliance for those **subscriptions**. **Management groups** provide a **governance scope above subscriptions**.

Note that **10,000 management groups** can be supported in a single directory and a management group tree can support **up to six levels of depth**.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (147).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

[From the docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/management-groups/overview#root-management-group-for-each-directory): Each directory is given a single **top-level management group called the root** management group. The root management group is built into the hierarchy to have **all management groups and subscriptions fold up to it**. This root management group allows for **global policies and Azure role assignments** to be applied at the directory level. The [Azure AD **Global Administrator** needs to elevate themselves](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/elevate-access-global-admin) to the **User Access Administrator role of this root group** initially. After elevating access, the administrator can **assign any Azure role to other directory users or groups to manage the hierarchy**. As administrator, you can assign **your own account as owner of the root** management group.

The root management group **can't be moved or deleted**, unlike other management groups.

Management groups give you enterprise-grade management at scale no matter what type of subscriptions you might have. However, **all subscriptions within a single management group** must trust the **same Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant**.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (157).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Azure Subscriptions

In Azure, a subscription serves as a **logical container** for the purpose of **provisioning** business or technical **resources**. This container maintains the **details of resources** such as virtual machines (VMs), databases, among others. Upon the creation of an Azure resource, like a VM, the **subscription associated with it** is specified. This structure facilitates the delegation of access, utilizing role-based access-control mechanisms.

### Resource Groups

[From the docs:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-python?tabs=macos#what-is-a-resource-group) A resource group is a **container** that holds **related resources** for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those **resources that you want to manage as a group**. Generally, add **resources** that share the **same lifecycle** to the same resource group so you can easily deploy, update, and delete them as a group.

All the **resources** must be **inside a resource group** and can belong only to a group and if a resource group is deleted, all the resources inside it are also deleted.

### Administrative Units

[From the docs:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/admin-units-manage) Administrative units let you **subdivide** your organization into **any unit** that you want, and then **assign specific administrators** that can **manage only the members** of that unit. For example, you could use administrative units to delegate permissions to administrators of each school at a large university, so they could control access, manage users, and set policies only in the School of Engineering.

Only **users**, **groups** and **devices** and be **members** of an **administrative unit**.

Therefore, an **Administrative unit** will **contain** some **members** and other **principals** will be **assigned permissions over that** administrative **unit** that they can use to **manage the members** of the administrative unit.

## Azure vs Azure AD vs Azure AD Domain Services

It's important to note that **Azure AD** is a service **inside** **Azure**. **Azure** is Microsoft's **cloud platform** whereas **Azure AD** is enterprise **identity** **service** in Azure.\
Moreover, **Azure AD is not like Windows Active Directory**, it's an identity service that works in a complete different way. If you want to run a **Domain Controller in Azure** for your Windows Active Directory environment you need to use **Azure AD Domain Services**.

## Principals

Azure support different type of principals:

* **User**: A regular **person** with credentials to access.
* **Group**: A **group of principals** managed together. **Permissions** granted to groups are **inherited** by its **members**.
*   **Service Principal/Enterprise Applications**: It's an **identity** created for **use** with **applications**, hosted services, and automated tools to access Azure resources. This access is **restricted by the roles assigned** to the service principal, giving you control over **which resources can be accessed** and at which level. For security reasons, it's always recommended to **use service principals with automated tools** rather than allowing them to log in with a user identity.

    When creating a **service principal** you can choose between **password authentication** or **certificate authentication**.

    * If you choose **password** auth (by default), **save the password generated** as you won't be able to access it again.
    * If you choose certificate authentication, make sure the **application will have access over the private key**.
* **Managed Identity (Metadata Creds)**: Managed identities in Azure Active Directory offer a solution for **automatically managing the identity** of applications. These identities are used by applications for the purpose of **connecting** to **resources** compatible with Azure Active Directory (**Azure AD**) authentication. By utilizing managed identities, applications can **secure Azure AD tokens** while eliminating the need to handle credentials directly. There are two types of managed identities:
  * **System-assigned**. Some Azure services allow you to **enable a managed identity directly on a service instance**. When you enable a system-assigned managed identity, an identity is created in Azure AD. The identity is tied to the **lifecycle of that service instance**. When the **resource** is **deleted**, Azure automatically **deletes** the **identity** for you. By design, only that Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Azure AD.
  * **User-assigned**. You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You can [create a user-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal) and assign it to one or **more instances** of an Azure service (multiple resources). For user-assigned managed identities, the **identity is managed separately from the resources that use it**.

## Roles & Permissions

**Roles** are **assigned** to **principals** on a **scope**: `principal -[HAS ROLE]->(scope)`

**Roles** assigned to **groups** are **inherited** by all the **members** of the group.

Depending on the scope the role was assigned to, the **role** cold be **inherited** to **other resources** inside the scope container. For example, if a user A has a **role on the subscription**, he will have that **role on all the resource groups** inside the subscription and on **all the resources** inside the resource group.

### **Classic Roles**

| **Owner**                     | <ul><li>Full access to all resources</li><li>Can manage access for other users</li></ul> | All resource types |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Contributor**               | <ul><li>Full access to all resources</li><li>Cannot manage access</li></ul>              | All resource types |
| **Reader**                    | ‚Ä¢ View all resources                                                                     | All resource types |
| **User Access Administrator** | <ul><li>View all resources</li><li>Can manage access for other users</li></ul>           | All resource types |

### Built-In roles

[From the docs: ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles)[Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) has several Azure **built-in roles** that you can **assign** to **users, groups, service principals, and managed identities**. Role assignments are the way you control **access to Azure resources**. If the built-in roles don't meet the specific needs of your organization, you can create your own [**Azure custom roles**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)**.**

**Built-In** roles apply only to the **resources** they are **meant** to, for example check this 2 examples of **Built-In roles over Compute** resources:

| [Disk Backup Reader](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#disk-backup-reader)                 | Provides permission to backup vault to perform disk backup.      | 3e5e47e6-65f7-47ef-90b5-e5dd4d455f24 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| [Virtual Machine User Login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-user-login) | View Virtual Machines in the portal and login as a regular user. | fb879df8-f326-4884-b1cf-06f3ad86be52 |

This roles can **also be assigned over logic containers** (such as management groups, subscriptions and resource groups) and the principals affected will have them **over the resources inside those containers**.

* Find here a list with [**all the Azure built-in roles**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).
* Find here a list with [**all the Azure AD built-in roles**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).

### Custom Roles

Azure also allow to create [**custom roles**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) with the permissions the user needs.

### Permission Denied

* In order for a **principal to have some access over a resource** he needs an explicit role being granted to him (anyhow) **granting him that permission**.
* An explicit **deny role assignment takes precedence** over the role granting the permission.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (191).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Global Administrator

Users with the Global Administrator role has the ability to '**elevate' to User Access Administrator Azure role to the root management group**. This means that a Global Administrator will be able to manage access **all Azure subscriptions and management groups.**\
This elevation can be done at the end of the page: [https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft\_AAD\_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/\~/Properties](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft\_AAD\_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/\~/Properties)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (162).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Azure Policies

Azure policies are a set of **rules and regulations in Microsoft Azur**e, a cloud computing service, that help manage and enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale. These policies enforce different rules over your **Azure resources**, ensuring that those resources stay compliant with corporate standards and service level agreements.

Azure policies are crucial for cloud governance and security, helping to ensure that resources are used properly and efficiently, and that they comply with external regulations and internal policies.\
Som examples:

1. **Ensuring Compliance with Specific Azure Regions**: This policy ensures that all resources are deployed in specific Azure regions. For example, a company might want to ensure all its data is stored in Europe for GDPR compliance.
2. **Enforcing Naming Standards**: Policies can enforce naming conventions for Azure resources. This helps in organizing and easily identifying resources based on their names, which is helpful in large environments.
3. **Restricting Certain Resource Types**: This policy can restrict the creation of certain types of resources. For example, a policy could be set to prevent the creation of expensive resource types, like certain VM sizes, to control costs.
4. **Enforcing Tagging Policies**: Tags are key-value pairs associated with Azure resources used for resource management. Policies can enforce that certain tags must be present, or have specific values, for all resources. This is useful for cost tracking, ownership, or categorization of resources.
5. **Limiting Public Access to Resources**: Policies can enforce that certain resources, like storage accounts or databases, do not have public endpoints, ensuring that they are only accessible within the organization's network.
6. **Automatically Applying Security Settings**: Policies can be used to automatically apply security settings to resources, such as applying a specific network security group to all VMs or ensuring that all storage accounts use encryption.

Note that Azure Policies can be attached to any level of the Azure hierarchy, but they are **commonly used in the root management group** or in other management groups.

### Permissions Scope

In Azure **permissions are can be assigned to any part of the hierarchy**. That includes management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and individual resources. Permissions are **inherited** by contained **resources** of the entity where they were assigned.

This hierarchical structure allows for efficient and scalable management of access permissions.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Azure RBAC vs ABAC

**RBAC** (role-based access control) is what we have seen already in the previous sections: **Assigning a role to a principal to grant him access** over a resource.\
However, in some cases you might want to provide **more fined-grained access management** or **simplify** the management of **hundreds** of role **assignments**.

Azure **ABAC** (attribute-based access control) builds on Azure RBAC by adding **role assignment conditions based on attributes** in the context of specific actions. A _role assignment condition_ is an **additional check that you can optionally add to your role assignment** to provide more fine-grained access control. A condition filters down permissions granted as a part of the role definition and role assignment. For example, you can **add a condition that requires an object to have a specific tag to read the object**.\
You **cannot** explicitly **deny** **access** to specific resources **using conditions**.

### Default User Permissions

A basic user will have some **default permissions** to enumerate some parts of AzureAD:

* Read all users, Groups, Applications, Devices, Roles, Subscriptions, and their public properties
* Invite Guests (_can be turned off_)
* Create Security groups
* Read non-hidden Group memberships
* Add guests to Owned groups
* Create new application (_can be turned off_)
* Add up to 50 devices to Azure (_can be turned off_)

You can see the full [list of **default permissions of users** in the docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions). Moreover, note that in that list you can also see the **guests default permissions list**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that to enumerate Azure resources the user needs an explicit grant of the permission.
{% endhint %}

### Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

Privileged Identity Management (PIM) in Azure is a tool that **manages, controls, and monitors privileged access** in Azure Active Directory and Azure. It enhances security by providing **just-in-time and time-limited privileged access**, **enforcing approval workflows, and requiring additional authentication**. This approach minimizes the risk of unauthorized access by ensuring that elevated permissions are granted only when necessary and for a specific duration.

## Authentication Tokens

There are **three types of tokens** used in OIDC:

* [**Access Tokens**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens)**:** The client presents this token to the resource server to **access resources**. It can be used only for a specific combination of user, client, and resource and **cannot be revoked** until expiry - that is 1 hour by default. Detection is low using this.
* **ID Tokens**: The client receives this **token from the authorization server**. It contains basic information about the user. It is **bound to a specific combination of user and client**.
* **Refresh Tokens**: Provided to the client with access token. Used to **get new access and ID tokens**. It is bound to a specific combination of user and client and can be revoked. Default expiry is **90 days** for inactive refresh tokens and **no expiry for active tokens**.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Information for **conditional access** is **stored** inside the **JWT**. So, if you request the **token from an allowed IP address**, that **IP** will be **stored** in the token and then you can use that token from a **non-allowed IP to access the resources**.
{% endhint %}

Check the following page to learn different ways to **request access tokens** and login with them:

{% content-ref url="az-azuread/" %}
[az-azuread](az-azuread/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The most common API endpoints are:

* **Azure Resource Manager** (ARM): management.azure.com
* **Microsoft Graph**: graph.microsoft.com (Azure AD Graph which is deprecated is graph.windows.net)
