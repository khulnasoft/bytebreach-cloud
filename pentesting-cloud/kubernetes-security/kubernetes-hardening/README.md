## Tools to analyse a cluster

### [**Kubescape**](https://github.com/armosec/kubescape)

[**Kubescape**](https://github.com/armosec/kubescape) is a K8s open-source tool providing a multi-cloud K8s single pane of glass, including risk analysis, security compliance, RBAC visualizer and image vulnerabilities scanning. Kubescape scans K8s clusters, YAML files, and HELM charts, detecting misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks (such as the [NSA-CISA](https://www.armosec.io/blog/kubernetes-hardening-guidance-summary-by-armo) , [MITRE ATT\&CK¬Æ](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/23/secure-containerized-environments-with-updated-threat-matrix-for-kubernetes/)), software vulnerabilities, and RBAC (role-based-access-control) violations at early stages of the CI/CD pipeline, calculates risk score instantly and shows risk trends over time.

```bash
kubescape scan --verbose
```

### [**Kube-bench**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench)

The tool [**kube-bench**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench) is a tool that checks whether Kubernetes is deployed securely by running the checks documented in the [**CIS Kubernetes Benchmark**](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/).\
You can choose to:

* run kube-bench from inside a container (sharing PID namespace with the host)
* run a container that installs kube-bench on the host, and then run kube-bench directly on the host
* install the latest binaries from the [Releases page](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench/releases),
* compile it from source.

### [**Kubeaudit**](https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit)

The tool [**kubeaudit**](https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit) is a command line tool and a Go package to **audit Kubernetes clusters** for various different security concerns.

Kubeaudit can detect if it is running within a container in a cluster. If so, it will try to audit all Kubernetes resources in that cluster:

```
kubeaudit all
```

This tool also has the argument `autofix` to **automatically fix detected issues.**

### [**Kube-hunter**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter)

The tool [**kube-hunter**](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-hunter) hunts for security weaknesses in Kubernetes clusters. The tool was developed to increase awareness and visibility for security issues in Kubernetes environments.

```bash
kube-hunter --remote some.node.com
```

### [**Kubei**](https://github.com/Erezf-p/kubei)

[**Kubei**](https://github.com/Erezf-p/kubei) is a vulnerabilities scanning and CIS Docker benchmark tool that allows users to get an accurate and immediate risk assessment of their kubernetes clusters. Kubei scans all images that are being used in a Kubernetes cluster, including images of application pods and system pods.

### [**KubiScan**](https://github.com/cyberark/KubiScan)

[**KubiScan**](https://github.com/cyberark/KubiScan) is a tool for scanning Kubernetes cluster for risky permissions in Kubernetes's Role-based access control (RBAC) authorization model.&#x20;

## **Audit IaC Code**

### [**Popeye**](https://github.com/derailed/popeye)

[**Popeye**](https://github.com/derailed/popeye) is a utility that scans live Kubernetes cluster and **reports potential issues with deployed resources and configurations**. It sanitizes your cluster based on what's deployed and not what's sitting on disk. By scanning your cluster, it detects misconfigurations and helps you to ensure that best practices are in place, thus preventing future headaches. It aims at reducing the cognitive \_over\_load one faces when operating a Kubernetes cluster in the wild. Furthermore, if your cluster employs a metric-server, it reports potential resources over/under allocations and attempts to warn you should your cluster run out of capacity.

### [**KICS**](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics)

[**KICS**](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics) finds **security vulnerabilities**, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations in the following **Infrastructure as Code solutions**: Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible, Helm, Microsoft ARM, and OpenAPI 3.0 specifications

### [**Checkov**](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov)

[**Checkov**](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) is a static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code.

It scans cloud infrastructure provisioned using [Terraform](https://terraform.io), Terraform plan, [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), [Dockerfile](https://www.docker.com), [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com) or [ARM Templates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) and detects security and compliance misconfigurations using graph-based scanning.

### [**Kube-score**](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score)

[**kube-score**](https://github.com/zegl/kube-score) is a tool that performs static code analysis of your Kubernetes object definitions.

To install:

## Tips

### Kubernetes PodSecurityContext and SecurityContext

You can configure the **security context of the Pods** (with _PodSecurityContext_) and of the **containers** that are going to be run (with _SecurityContext_). For more information read:

{% content-ref url="kubernetes-securitycontext-s.md" %}
[kubernetes-securitycontext-s.md](kubernetes-securitycontext-s.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Kubernetes API Hardening

It's very important to **protect the access to the Kubernetes Api Server** as a malicious actor with enough privileges could be able to abuse it and damage in a lot of way the environment.\
It's important to secure both the **access** (**whitelist** origins to access the API Server and deny any other connection) and the [**authentication**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-authentication-authorization/) (following the principle of **least** **privilege**). And definitely **never** **allow** **anonymous** **requests**.

**Common Request process:**\
User or K8s ServiceAccount ‚Äì> Authentication ‚Äì> Authorization ‚Äì> Admission Control.

**Tips**:

* Close ports.
* Avoid Anonymous access.
* NodeRestriction; No access from specific nodes to the API.
  * [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#noderestriction](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#noderestriction)
  * Basically prevents kubelets from adding/removing/updating labels with a node-restriction.kubernetes.io/ prefix. This label prefix is reserved for administrators to label their Node objects for workload isolation purposes, and kubelets will not be allowed to modify labels with that prefix.
  * And also, allows kubelets to add/remove/update these labels and label prefixes.
* Ensure with labels the secure workload isolation.
* Avoid specific pods from API access.
* Avoid ApiServer exposure to the internet.
* Avoid unauthorized access RBAC.
* ApiServer port with firewall and IP whitelisting.

### SecurityContext Hardening

By default root user will be used when a Pod is started if no other user is specified. You can run your application inside a more secure context using a template similar to the following one:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 3000
    fsGroup: 2000
  volumes:
  - name: sec-ctx-vol
    emptyDir: {}
  containers:
  - name: sec-ctx-demo
    image: busybox
    command: [ "sh", "-c", "sleep 1h" ]
   securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    volumeMounts:
    - name: sec-ctx-vol
      mountPath: /data/demo
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: true
```

* [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/)
* [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/)


### General Hardening

You should update your Kubernetes environment as frequently as necessary to have:

* Dependencies up to date.
* Bug and security patches.

[**Release cycles**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/): Each 3 months there is a new minor release -- 1.20.3 = 1(Major).20(Minor).3(patch)

**The best way to update a Kubernetes Cluster is (from** [**here**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/cluster-upgrade/)**):**

* Upgrade the Master Node components following this sequence:
  * etcd (all instances).
  * kube-apiserver (all control plane hosts).
  * kube-controller-manager.
  * kube-scheduler.
  * cloud controller manager, if you use one.
* Upgrade the Worker Node components such as kube-proxy, kubelet.
