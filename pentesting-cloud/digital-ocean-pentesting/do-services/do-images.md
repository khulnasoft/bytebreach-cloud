## Basic Information

DigitalOcean Images are **pre-built operating system or application images** that can be used to create new Droplets (virtual machines) on DigitalOcean. They are similar to virtual machine templates, and they allow you to **quickly and easily create new Droplets with the operating system** and applications that you need.

DigitalOcean provides a wide range of Images, including popular operating systems such as Ubuntu, CentOS, and FreeBSD, as well as pre-configured application Images such as LAMP, MEAN, and LEMP stacks. You can also create your own custom Images, or use Images from the community.

When you create a new Droplet on DigitalOcean, you can choose an Image to use as the basis for the Droplet. This will automatically install the operating system and any pre-installed applications on the new Droplet, so you can start using it right away. Images can also be used to create snapshots and backups of your Droplets, so you can easily create new Droplets from the same configuration in the future.
